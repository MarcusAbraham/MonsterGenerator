Monster Name,Description
Aarakocra,"Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an end less storm of mighty winds and lashing rai ns that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.  Enemies of Elemental Evil. In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fi ght to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.  On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to  the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for  nascent threats to  their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind unburdened and ever moving- yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.  Aarakocra have no concept of political borders or property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and other precious materials  means little to aarakocra. In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use. Search for the Seven Shards. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa come from a race of elemental beings called the vaati, which once ruled many worlds. A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplana r war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty Rod of Law. In a battle against the queen's greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear. The rod shattered into seven shards that scattered across the multiverse. Aaracokra seek signs of the pieces' locations in order to rebuild what is now know as the Rod of Seven Parts.

Aboleth,"Large aberration,  lawful evil"
Aboleth,"Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves.  Aboleths have never forgotten. Eternal Memories. Aboleths have flawless memories.  They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds. Aboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from  prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.  Gods in the Lake. Aboleths dwell in watery  environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from  their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.  Aboleths use their telepathic powers to  read the minds  of creatures and know their desires. An  aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, s uch as its followers,  the illusion of promised rewards.  Enemies of the Gods. The aboleths' fall  from power  is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.  Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the  gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution. "
