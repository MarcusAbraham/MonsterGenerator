Monster Name,Description
Aarakocra,"Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an end less storm of mighty winds and lashing rai ns that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.  Enemies of Elemental Evil. In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fi ght to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.  On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to  the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for  nascent threats to  their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind unburdened and ever moving- yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.  Aarakocra have no concept of political borders or property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and other precious materials  means little to aarakocra. In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use. Search for the Seven Shards. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa come from a race of elemental beings called the vaati, which once ruled many worlds. A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplana r war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty Rod of Law. In a battle against the queen's greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear. The rod shattered into seven shards that scattered across the multiverse. Aaracokra seek signs of the pieces' locations in order to rebuild what is now know as the Rod of Seven Parts.  SUMMONING  AIR  ElEM.ENTALS Five aarakocra within  30 feet of each other can  magically summon an  air elemental.  Each  of the five must use its action  and  movement on  three consecu tive turn s to  perform an  aerial  dance and  must maintain concentration while doing so  (as  if concentrating on  a spell).  When  all  five  have finished  their third turn  of the dance, the elemental  appears in  an  unoccupied  space within  60 feet of them . It  is fri endly toward them  and obeys their spoken com mands.  It  remains for  1 hour,  until  it or all  its summoners di e,  or until  any of its  summoners dismisses it as  a bonu s action . A summoner can't perform the dance again  until  it finishe s a short rest. When  the elemental  returns to the  Elemental  Plane of Air, any aarakocra within  5 feet of it can  return  with  it.

Aboleth,"Large aberration,  lawful evil  Armor Class 17  (natura l armor) Hit Points 135  (18d10 + 36) Speed 10ft., swim 40ft. "
Aboleth,"Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves.  Aboleths have never forgotten. Eternal Memories. Aboleths have flawless memories.  They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds. Aboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from  prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.  Gods in the Lake. Aboleths dwell in watery  environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from  their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.  Aboleths use their telepathic powers to  read the minds  of creatures and know their desires. An  aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, s uch as its followers,  the illusion of promised rewards.  Enemies of the Gods. The aboleths' fall  from power  is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.  Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the  gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution. "

Air Elemental," An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face.

Androsphinx," An  androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults or negative observations. Beneath this gruff exterior, however, an androsphinx has a noble heart. It has no wish to  lie or deceive, but it doesn't give away information readily, choosing its words as wisely as it guards its secrets. An androsphinx tests the courage and valor of  supplicants, not only by forcing them to complete quests but also with its terrible roar, which echoes for  miles as it  terrifies and deafens nearby creatures. Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast. "

Animated Armor," This empty steel shell clamors as it moves, heavy plates banging and grinding against one another like the vengeful spirit of a fallen knight. Ponderous but persistent, this magical guardian is almost always a suit of plate armor.  To add to its menace, animated armor is frequently enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare suits of animated armor are able to carry on an actual conv'et:s ation. "
Ankheg,"An ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged insect, its long antennae twitching in response to any movement around it. Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.  Lurkers in the Earth. The ankheg uses its powerful  mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and. seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.  Bane of Field and Forest. Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting gro~nds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.  Earthen Tunnels. As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature's attack.  -  ·===  -"

Banshee,"When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that  vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.  Divine Wrath. Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the Jiving. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes their transformation into undead monsters.  Sorrow Bound. A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every momerit of its life ~ith perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for. its doom.  Beauty Hoarders. The vanity that inspired the  banshee's cursed creatipn persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine je~elry, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to see the horror_ of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.  Undead Nature. A banshee doesn't require air, food,  c "
Barlgura," The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of t'he Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes,  keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.  ,A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility. "

"
Basilisk,"Travelers sometimes find  objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off.  Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to  be nearby. Adaptable Predators. Basilisks  thrive in arid, temperate,  or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.  A basilisk born and raised in  captivity can be domesticated and trained.  Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to  protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.  Gaze of Stone. Basilisks a re ponderous for hunting  creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to  organic form in the basilis k's gullet.  Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return petrified creatures to  flesh and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form  remain absent if the creature revives. Revivification using the oil  is impossible if a vital part of the petrified creature, s uch as its head,  is detached ."

Bulette,"A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also· called a ""land shark,"" it lives only to feed.  Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack with no regard for superior numbers or strength.  Underground Hunters. Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the eaFth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to moveme nt, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.  Wandering Monster. A bulette ranges across  temperate lands, feeding on a ny a nimals and humanoids it comes  across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh , although they often kill them before realizing what they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, a nd it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.  A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its s ole criterion for territory is availability of food,  and when it has eaten everything in an area , a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents  have fled, or until the bulette is s lain.  All creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food- even other predators and bulettes . Bulettes  come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and  teeth that usually ends with the male's death a nd  consumpti on.  Arcane Creation. Some sages believe the bulette  is the result of a mad wiza rd 's experiments at crossbreeding sn apping turtles a nd armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but a fter yea rs without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young a re almost never seen, s ome sages s uspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.  34 "
Bullywug,"Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, ma rshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.  Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.  Foul Aristocracy. Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader- a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.  A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind.  It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds s ecret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods.are reduced to filthy tatters throug.h abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.  Unruly Diplomacy. Bullywugs love nothing more than  lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.  Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size- and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its ""guests"" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.  Amphibian Allies. Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.  Simple concepts in the language are understandable  to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.

Cambion,"A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage.  Born to Be Bad. Cambions grow into ruthless adults  whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it.  Pawns of the Mighty. A cambion forced to serve its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence. Cambions raised in  the Nine Hells serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.  Spawn ofGraz'zt. The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six fingered hands, and unearthly beauty.  3fday each: alter self,  command,  detect magic 1fday:  plane shift  (self only) "

Chasme," This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable cros sing of humanoid and fly.  A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find  purchase on walls and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the approach of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack.  The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as  interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to dole out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of reprisal. "

Cyclops,"Cyclopes are one-eyed giants that eke out a meager existence in wild lands. Isolationists by nature, they avoid contact with other races and try to drive away strangers in their territory.  Nonreligious. Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to  any deities. They see little benefit in prayer and dislike ritual, which they perceive as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops that gains direct benefit from some site of divine power, or which is threatened by a supernatural force or creature, will pay homage as long as the benefit or threat remains. Unsophisticated. Though they are reasonably  intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food.  They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, )airing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.  A cyclops lairs within a day's journey of other  cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will  use metal when they can find  it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other.  Cyclopes don't use money for  trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.  Unwise. Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes.  Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure.  However, their sense of pride causes them to  react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a ""god"" is a mere mortal.

Dao," Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from  precious gems and rare metals, and when they fly,  their lower bodies become columns of swirling sand. A dao isn't happy unless it is the envy of other dao.  All That Glitters. The dao dwell in complexes of twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns on the Elemental Plane of Earth. These mazeworks are continually expanding as the dao delve into and reshape the rock around them. Dao care nothing for the poverty or misfortune of others. A dao might grind powdered gems and gold dust over its food  to heighten the experience of eating, devouring its wealth as mortals consume a precious spice.  Lords of the Earth.

This ""demilich"" contains only a fragment of the lich's malevolent life force- just enough so that if it is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume a wraithlike form. The skull  then emits a terrifying howl  that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear.  Left alone, it sinks back down and returns to  the empty peace of its existence.  Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an end to  the existence they hoped to  preserve by becoming undead. However, time can erode the lich's reason and memory, causing it to  retreat into its ancient tomb and forget to feed  on souls.

A sick or inactive gorgon gathers rust like fungus or mange. When a rusty gorgon moves, its  plates squeal as they rub together.  Monstrous Predator. When a gorgon spots potential  prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and sends its sprawling, then tramples it to death with its cruel hooves. Faced with multipl e foes, the gorgon exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures it touches by turning them to stone. When it grows hungry, it smashes its petrified prey to  rubble and uses its strong teeth to grind the stone into a powder that provides nourishment. The crisscrossing network of trampled trails and splintered trees that s urrounds a gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its shattered foes.

Goristro," The goristro resembles a fiendish minotaur t0wering1 more than twenty feet tall. When controlled by a demon lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and prized pets. Goristros possess preternatural cunning when navigating labyrinthine passages and shifting corridors, pursuing foes in a terrifying hunt.

Green Hag," The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.  Obsession with Tragedy.

Grick,"The wormlike grick waits unseen, blending in with the rock of the caves and caverns it haunts. Only when prey comes  near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal its hungry, s napping beak.  Passive Predators. Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they  drag their rubbery bodies  to  places where creatures regul a rly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to  ledges, or coiling a round stalactites to drop on unwary prey.  A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for  other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fall en creature with its tentacles and  dragging it off  to eat alone.  Roving Ambush ers. Gricks remain in an area until  the food s upply dwindles, often because s entient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes a round their lairs. When prey is scarce in  the  Underd ark , gricks venture aboveground to hunt in  the wilderness, lurking in  trees or on cliff-side ledges . A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed,  oversized a lpha around which the others congregate.  Spoils of Slaughter. Over time,  grick lairs accumulate  the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, a nd expert guides  know to  look out for  these telltale signs. Underdark explorers sometimes seal  off the routes leading to a nd from  a grick lair to s tarve them,  then cla im  the wealth of the foul  creatures' victims . "
Grimlock,"The degenerate subterranean grimlocks were once human, but their worship of the mind flayers over generations of prowling the Underdark transformed them into blind, monstrous cannibals long ago.  Debased Cultists. The empire of the mind flayers once spread across many worlds, enslaving countless races. Among those were human cultures whose high priests  the mind flayers subverted using their insidious powers of thought control. Those leaders gradually turned the faiths of their followers toward the illithids, which they worshiped as blasphemous deities.  Over time, the rituals of these enslaved humans created fervent cannibal cults that regarded the brain eating of the mind flayers as a holy sacrament. The illithids commanded their worshipers to abduct other sentient creatures to be sacrificed. After the victims' brains had been consumed, the mind flayers gave the lifeless bodies to the cultists.  Blind Hunters. When the rule of the mind flayers crumbled, their cults faced constant warfare from their enemies, the same creatures that had once been their victims. The cults fled into the Underdark domains of their illithid gods. Over generations in that lightless realm, the cultists learned to rely on their other senses for survival. In time, their eyes withered away and eyelids sealed, leaving only covered eye sockets behind. A grimlock's ears prick up at the faintest footfa ll or whisper echoing down stone passageways. It can speak in tones too low for most other humanoids to hear. The odors of sweat, flesh, a nd blood awaken its  hunger, and it can track by such scents like a bloodhound. To enhance their senses, grim locks leave tra ils of blood, piles of dung, or the viscera of slai n prey in places far from their lairs. When intruders pass  through those areas, they carry the foul scents with them, wa rning the grimlocks of their approach.  For most creatures, blindness is an enormous hindrance. For a grimlock with its other heightened senses, sightlessness is a boon. A grimlock isn't fooled by visual illusions or misperceptions. It is fearless as it stalks  prey.  Endless War.  Grimlocks still venerate the mind  flayers, serving them whenever possible. Grim locks also recall the war in which they were driven underground. To them, it has never ended. They continue to return to the surface world to abduct captives for their illithid masters. "

Gynosphinx," A gynosphinx bears the head of a humanoid female. Many have the regal countenances of worldly queens, but some are marked with wild, leonine features. A gynosphinx's eyes see beyond the present time and place, and penetrate veils of invisibility and magic. Supplicants who look deep into those eyes might find themselves magically displaced, banished to some far flung plane where a difficult trial awaits them.  Gynosphinxes are virtual libraries of knowledge and lore. They ask riddles and present puzzles to  test the wit of supplicants that come to learn their secrets. Some are willing to bargain with such supplicants for treasure or service. "
Harpy,"Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.  A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human. Its wicked talons and bone club make it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.  Divine Curse. Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to  tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a  handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled,  vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.  Though the elf searched the woods and called for  her  stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven  o1 despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf. . When her singing failed  to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to  her ~ide, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh,  even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.  Harpy Song. To hear a harpy's song is to  hear music more beautiful than anything else in  the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.  Sadistic Cowards. Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs  and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight,  and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight  turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.  When they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the ""music"" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe  and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.  Gruesome Collectors. Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from  their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden in remote r'uins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul  piles of offal.

Although physically powerful, they are weak minded and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful demons. As they press their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their foul stench can sicken even the toughest foes. "
Hill Giant," Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt forage, and raid in constant search of food.  They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, ' bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.  Primitive. Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain  valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from  the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.  Bigger Means Better. In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.  Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.  Voracious Eaters. With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf compan ion , so as to  not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.  Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator  such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off,  a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family  is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.  Stupid and Deadly. The hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped. With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.  In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one  ""( "

Homunculus,"Shaping a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, and blood, one can channel rare ritual magic to create a faithful, squirrel-sized companion.  A homunculus is a construct that acts as an extension  of its creator, with the two sharing thoughts, senses, and language through a mystical bond. A master can have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create another one always fail),  and when its master dies, the homunculus also dies.  Shared Mind. A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation or adventuring.  r88"
Hook Horror,"A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls. The monstrous hook horror has a head resembling a vulture's and the torso of an enormous beetle, with an exoskeleton studded by sharp, bony protuberances. It gains its name from  its long, powerfully built arms a.nd legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws.  Echoes in the Dark. Hook horrors communicate by striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like random clacking noise is actually a complex language that only hook horrors understand, and which carries for  miles through the echoing Underdark.  Pack Predators. The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi,  plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from  above. They hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.  Dedicated Clans. Hook horrors live in extended family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the eldest female, who typically places her mate in charge of the clan's hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's home caverns.  !89"

Hydra,"The hydra is a reptilian horror with a crocodilian body and multiple heads on long, serpentine necks. Although its heads can be severed, the hydra magically regrows ' them in short order. A typical specimen has five  heads.  At the dawn of time, Tiamat, the Queen of Evil  Dragons, slew a rival dragon god named Lernaea and cast her blood across the multiverse. Each drop that fell upon a world spawned a multi-headed hydra consumed by a hunger as great as the fallen god's hatred. Great champions are known to test their mettle against these fearsome creatures.  Everlasting Hunger. A rapacious and gluttonous monster, a hydra snatches and tears ~part its prey in a frenzy of feeding. When a hydra has cleared a territory of food  and driven off any creatures smart enough to avoid it, it moves on to seek its meals elsewhere. A hydra's hunger is so great that if it can't feed,  it might turn against itself, its heads attacking each other as the creature eats itself alive.  Hardy Water DweJJers. Hydras are natural  swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins.  When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains  awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.

Imp," Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. An imp will proudly serve an evil master of any kind, but it can't be relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency. An imp can assume animal form  at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with its poison stinger. "
Intellect Devourer,"An intellect devourer resembles a walking brain protected by a crusty covering and set on bestial clawed legs. This foul  aberration feeds on the intelligence of sentient creatures, taking over a victim's body on behalf of its mind ftayer masters.  1/lithid Creations. Mind ftayers breed intellect  devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator as twisted and evil as its masters.  Deadly Puppet Masters. An  intellect devourer  consumes a creature's mind and memories, then turns the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others into the domain of the mind flayers to  be enthralled or consumed. "

Kenku,"Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.  Fallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.  Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings,  embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to  beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever. Speech in Pantomime. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking t9gether, and a  kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vend9rs, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.  Kenku speak to one another in much the same  way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a eat's meow might be the secret code for ""Prepare to attack!"" or ""Flee for your lives!""  Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and  criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.  The Wistful Wingless. All kenku pine for the ability  to fly,  and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final,  tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs. "

Lemure," A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil and banished to the Nine Hells for  eternity. The lowest type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures doomed to suffer torment until they are promoted to a higher form of devil, most commonly an imp.  A lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent expression of anguish twists across its face,  its feeble mouth babbling even though it can't speak. "
Lich,"Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for  long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.  A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with  withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.  Secrets ofUndeath. No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.  A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from  traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.  With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a  potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.  Soul Sacrifices. A lich must periodically feed souls to  its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the imprisonment spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to  magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.  A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with  sacrificed souls begins to  physically fall  apart, and might eventually become a demilich.  Death and Restoration. When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of  its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well guarded location.  Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.  Lonely Existence. From time to  time, a lich might be !  stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to .take an interest in the world around it,  most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures  ~  ,. whose service helps secure its lair.  Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.  Magic Collectors. Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spell books, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to  use whenever its lair comes under attack.  Undead Nature. A lich doesn't require air, food,  drink, or sleep.  A LicH's LAIR A lich often haunts the abode it favored  in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps.  Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.  A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of "

Manes," Souls of evil creatures that descend to the Lower Planes are transformed into manes-the lowest form of demonkind. These wretched fiends attack any non demon they see, and they are called to the Material Plane by those seeking to sow death and chaos.  Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power to transform manes into undead monsters, most often ghouls and shadows. Other demon lords feed on manes, destroying them utterly. Otherwise, killing a  manes causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that reforms into another manes after one day. "
Marid," Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to  the flighty djinn, the ground hugging dao, and the fuming efreet.  Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to  behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons they favor.  They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a  rocky cliff. In flight,  their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.  Water Lords. Water is a marid's native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog  and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to  bludgeon its foes.  Marid Homes. Marids are rare on the Material Plane.  They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels float in the depths of the plane and contain opulent, air filled chambers where slaves and guests reside.  A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves, simply  wanting to have them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and aren't above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.  Egotistical Hierarchs. All  mar ids claim a title of  nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the self-important marids.  Marids treat all others-including other genies- as inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.  Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a creature that knows its place.  Whimsical Storytellers. Marids are champion tale tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't always malicious in their deception, but embellishments suit their fancy.  Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath."

Marilith,"balor,  goristro  5~"
Marilith," Terrible to behold, a marilith has the lower body of a great serpent and the upper torso of a humanoid female with six arms.  Wielding a wicked blade in each of its six hands, a  marilith is a devastating foe that few can match in battle. These demons possess keen minds and a finely honed sense of tactics, and they are able to lead and unite other demons in common cause. Mariliths are often encountered as captains at the head of a demonic horde, where they embrace any opportunity to rush headlong into battle. "
Medusa,"As deadly as they are ravishing, the serpent-haired medusas suffer an immortal curse brought on by their vanity. They lurk in quiet exile among the tumbled ruins of their former lives, surrounded by the petrified remains of past admirers and would-be heroes.  Immortal Splendor. Men and women who desire  eternal youth, beauty, and adoration might pray to malicious gods, beg dragons for ancient magic, or seek out powerful archmages to fulfill  their wishes. Others make sacrifices to demon lords or archdevils, offering all in exchange for  this gift, oblivious to the curse that accompanies it. Those who strike such bargains gain physical beauty, restored youth, immortality, and the adoration of all who behold them, granting them the influence and power they so desire. However, after years of the living like a demigod among mortals, the price for their vanity and hubris is exacted, and they are forever transformed into medusas. A medusa's hair turns into a nest of venomous serpents, and all who gaze upon the medusa are petrified, becoming stone monuments to its c.orruption.  214"
Merfolk,"Aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a  human and the lower body of a fish,  merfolk adorn their skin and scales with shell decorations.  Merfolk tribes and kingdoms span the world, and their people are as varied in color, culture, and outlook as the human races of the surface. Land folk and mer folk rarely meet except by chance, though star-eyed mariners tell tales of romance with these creatures along the shoals of faraway islands.  Merfolk lack the materials and practical means to forge weapons beneath the waves, to write books and keep lore, or to shape stone to raise buildings and cities. As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. Only occasionally do mer folk unite under the rule of a single leader. They do so to face a common threat or to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the beginning of undersea kingdoms with dynasties lasting hundreds of years.  Merfolk Settlements. Merfolk build their settlements  in vast undersea caverns, mazes of coral, the ruins of sunken cities, or structures they carve from the rocky seabed. They live in water shallow enough that the passage of time can be marked by the gleam and fade of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches near their settlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm the seabed, shepherding schools of fish as land-based farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and in their undersea caverns, merfolk rely on the light of bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jellyfish, whose slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an otherworldly aesthetic.  Merfolk defend their communities with spears  crafted from whatever materials they can salvage from shipwrecks, beaches, and dead undersea creatures. "
Merrow,"Merrow haunt coastal waters, preying on fisherfolk, merfolk, and any other edible creature that crosses their path. These savage monsters snatch and devour unwary prey, hauling drowned corpses back to their underwater grottoes to  feed.  Transformed Merfolk. Long ago, a tribe of merfolk found an idol of Demogorgon at the bottom of the sea. Not knowing what it was, they brought the artifact to their king. Everyone who touched the idol became afflicted with madness, including the king, who decreed that a sacrificial ritual be performed to open a gateway to  the Abyss. The ocean turned red with the blood of slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the king led the survivors through the underwater gate to Demogorgon's layer of the Abyss. The merfolk remained there for generations, fighting for their lives as the Abyss warped them completely, transforming them into hulking, evil monstrosities. Thus, the first merrow were born.  Coastal Bullies. Whenever an opportunity presents  itself, the Prince of Demons sends merrow back to the Material Plane to wreak havoc in the oceans. The merrow are bullies, attacking all creatures smaller and weaker than themselves.  Merrow dwell in undersea caves filled with treasures  and trophies, taken from their victims and sunken ships. They tie the rotting corpses of dead enemies and drowned sailors to strands of kelp to mark the borders of their territory. "

Minotaur,"A minotaur's roar is a savage battle cry that most civilized creatures fear. Born into the mortal realm by demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt. Their brown or black fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes, and they carry the stench of death.  The Beast Within. Most minotaurs are solitary carnivores that roam labyrinthine dungeons, twisting caves, primeval woods, and the maze-like streets and passages of desolate ruins. A minotaur can visualize every route it might take to close the distance to its prey.  The scent of blood, the tearing of flesh, and the cracking of bones spur a minotaur's lust for carnage, overwhelming all thought and reason. In a blood rage, a minotaur charges anything it sees, butting and goring like a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain. Apart from ambushing creatures that wander into its labyrinth, a minotaur cares little for strategy or tactics. Minotaurs seldom organize, they don't respect authority or hierarchy, and they are notoriously difficult to enslave, let alone control.  Cults of the Horned King. Minotaurs are the dark descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of cults that reject the oppression of authority by returning to nature. Inductees often mistake these cults for druidic circles or totemic religions whose ceremonies involve entering a labyrinth while wearing a ceremonial animal mask.  Within these bounded environments, cultists hunt, kill, and eat wild beasts, indulging their basest primal urges. In the end, however, sacrificial animals are exchanged for humanoid sacrifice- sometimes an inductee that tried to escape the cult after learning its secrets. These labyrinths become blood-soaked halls of slaughter, echoing to the cultists' savagery.  Unknown to all but their highest-ranking leaders, these mystery cults are creations of the demon lord Baphomet, the Horned King, whose layer of the Abyss is a gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent supplicants that plead for strength and power. Others come to the cult seeking a life free from authority's chains- and are liberated of their humanity instead as Baphomet transforms them into the minotaurs that echo his own savage form.  Although they begin as creations of the Horned King, minotaurs can breed true with one another, giving rise to an independent race of Baphomet's savage children in the world.

Mummy Lord," In the tombs of the ancients, tyrannical monarchs and the high priests of dark gods lie in dreamless rest, waiting for the time when they might reclaim their thrones and reforge their ancient empires. The regalia of their terrible rule still adorns their linen-wrapped bodies, their moldering robes stitched with evil symbols and bronze armor etched with devices of dynasties that fell a thousand years before.  Under the direction of the most powerful priests, the ritual that creates a mummy can be increased in potency. The mummy lord that rises from such a ritual retains the memories and personality of its former life, and is gifted with supernatural resilience. Dead emperors wield the same infamous rune-marked blades that they did in legend. Sorcerer lords work the forbidden magic that once controlled a terrified populace, and the dark gods reward dead priest-kings' prayers by imparting divine spells.  Heart of the Mummy Lord. As part of the ritual that creates a mummy lord, the creature's heart and viscera are removed from the corpse and placed in canopic jars. These jars are usually carved from limestone or made of pottery, etched or painted with religious hieroglyphs.  As long as its shriveled heart remains intact, a mummy lord can't be permanently destroyed. When it drops to 0 hit points, the mummy lord turns to dust and re-forms at full strength 24 hours later, rising out of dust in close proximity to the canopic jar containing its heart. A mummy lord can be destroyed or prevented from re-forming by burning its heart to ashes. For this reason, a mummy lord usually keeps its heart and viscera in a hidden tomb or vault.  The mummy lord's heart has AC 5, 25 hit points, and  immunity to all damage except fire. "
Nalfeshnee,"marilith balor,  goristro  5~"
Nalfeshnee," The nalfeshnee is one of the most grotesque demons- a corpulent mockery of ape and boar standing twice the height of a human, with feathered wings that seem · too small for its bloated body. These brutish features conceal a remarkable intelligence and cunning. Nalfeshnees are devastating in combat, using their wings to soar above the front ranks and reach vulnerable adversaries that can be dispatched with little effort From the thick of battle, they telepathically bellow commands to lesser demons, even as they inspire a sense of dread that forces their foes to scatter and run. Nalfeshnees feed on hatred and despair, but they crave humanoid flesh above all else. They keep their larders filled with humanoids abducted from  the Material Plane, then eat those creatures alive during elaborate feasts. Thinking of themselves as refined and cultured, nalfeshnees employ stained and rusted cutlery when they dine. "
Nightmare,"A nightmare appears in a cloud of roiling smoke, its mane, tail, and hooves wreathed in flame. The creature's unearthly black form moves with supernatural speed, vanishing in a cloud of brimstone as quickly as it appeared.  Dread Steed. Also called a ""demon horse"" or ""hell horse,"" the nightmare serves as a steed for creatures of exceptional evil, carrying demons, devils, death knights, liches, night hags, and other vile monsters. It resembles a fiendish horse, and a nightmare's fiery red eyes betray its malevolent intelligence.  A nightmare can be summoned from the Lower  Planes, but unless a worthy sacrifice is offered to it as food  upon its arrival, the nightmare displays no special loyalty to the creature it serves.  Creating a Nightmare. Nightmares don't appear naturally in the multiverse. They must be created from pegasi. The ritual that creates a nightmare requires the torturous removal of a pegasus's wings, driving that noble creature to evil as it is transformed by dark magic.  235"

Oni,"In nursery rhymes, oni are fearsome bogeymen that haunt the nightmares of children and adults alike, yet they are very real and always hungry. They find human babies especially delicious. Oni look like demonic ogres with blue or green skin, dark hair, and a pair of s hort ivory horns protruding from their foreheads. Their eyes are dark with strikingly white pupils, and their teeth and claws are jet black.  Night Haunters. By the light of day, an oni hides its true form with magic, gaining the trust of those it intends to betray when darkness descends. These creatures can change their size as well as their shape, appearing as humanoids as they pass through towns, pretending to be travelers, woodcutters, or frontier folk. In such a form, an oni takes stock of the selection of humanoids in a settlement and devises ways to abduct and devour some of them.  Magical Ogres. Oni are sometimes called ogre mages  because of their innate magical ability. Though they are only distantly related to true ogres, they share the ogres' habit of joining forces with other evil creatures. An oni serves a master if doing so proves lucrative or provides it with a luxurious, well-defended home.

Owl,"Tiny beast,  unaligned  Armor Class 11 Hit Points 1 (ld4- 1) Speed 5 ft.,  fly  60ft. "
Owlbear,"An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.  Deadly Ferocity. The owlbear's reputation for ferocity,  aggression, stubbornnes~. and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.  Consummate Predators. An owl bear emerges  from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.  An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.  Owl bears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than 'is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.  Savage Companions. Although they are more  intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owl bear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.  Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owl bears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.  Ow/bear Origins. Scholars have long debated the origins of the owl bear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owl bears have always existed in  the Feywild.

Peryton,"Although this monstrous carnivore feeds on any creature, it prefers humanoids, especially elves, half-elves, and humans. When it kills a humanoid, a peryton rips out its prey's heart and takes it back to its nest to be devoured.  The peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's physical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to trans form into the first perytons.  Unnatural Hunger. A peryton's reproductive cycle depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The organ must be consumed by a female peryton before she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart, its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true monstrous form.  When attacking a humanoid, a peryton is single  minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies. If a peryton is somehow driven away, it stalks lost prey from afar, attacking again whe n the opportunity arises.  Bane of the Mountains. Perytons roost atop  mountain ridges a nd lair in high caves. They prey on creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a wary eye on the sky. Because norma l weapons are less effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains know to avoid confrontations with these mons ters at all costs .  Establis hed settlements are attractive to perytons as a renewable food source. As such, village councils and local nobles' often hire adventurers to eliminate peryton nests.  . "

Piercer,"Clinging to  the ceilings of caverns and large subterranean passages, piercers blend in perfectly with natural rock, dropping in silence to  impale unsuspecting foes on the ground below.  A piercer is the larval form of a roper, and the two  creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls and ceilings to  position itself for prey. With its eye and mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from ordinary rock formations .  Patient Hunters. Piercers can see, but they can also respond to noise and heat, waiting for  living creatures to pass beneath them, then falling to attack. A piercer that misses its chance to kill must make its slow way back to the ceiling. A fallen  piercer excretes a foul-smelling slime when attacked, making most predators think twice about eating it.  Piercers gather in colonies to  maximize the  effectiveness of their attacks, dropping simultaneously to increase the odds of striking prey. After a piercer successfully slays a creature, the others slowly creep toward the corpse to join in the feast."
Pit Fiend," The undisputed lords of most other devils, pit fiends attend the archdukes and archduchesses of the Nine Hells and carry out their wishes. These mighty devils are the generals of the Nine Hells, leading its infernal legions into battle.  With an inflated sense of superiority and entitlement,  pit fiends form a grotesque aristocracy in  the infernal realm. These domineering and manipulative tyrants conspire to eliminate anything that stands between them and their desires, even as they negotiate the convoluted and dangerous politics of the Nine Hells.  A pit fiend  is a hulking monster with a whip-like tail and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a cloak. Armored scales cover its body, and its fanged maw drips a venom that can lay  the mightiest mortal creatures low.  Fearless in  battle, a pit fiend  takes on the most powerful foes in single combat, demonstrating its supremacy and an arrogance that prevents it from acknowledging any chance of defeat. "

Pixie,"Standing barely a foot tall, pixies resemble diminutive elves with gossamer wings like those of dragonflies or butterflies, bright as the clear dawn and as luminous as the full  moonrise. Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce themselves and strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh.  Pixies array themselves like princes and  princesses of the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond. Some dress in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride in their regalia and beam with joy when they are complimented on their ensembles.  Magical Faerie Folk. With their innate power of invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be seen. In the Feywild and on the Material Plane, pixies etch patterns of frost on winter ponds and rouse the buds in springtime. They cause flowers to sparkle with summer dew, and color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn.  Pixie Dust. When pixies fly visibly, a shower of  sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star. A mere sprinkle of pixie dust is said to be able to grant the power of flight, confuse a creature hopelessly, or send foes into a magical slumber. Only pixies can use their dust to its full  potential, but these fey are constantly sought out by mages and monsters seeking to study or master their power.  Tiny Tricksters. While the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to measure their reactions. For example, pixies might tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer to guide their ""guests"" along a safe route or invite them to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor.  Opposed to Violence. Unlike their fey cousins, the sprites, pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee than get into il physical altercation with any enemy. "
Planetar,"Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, presenting a tangible representation of their deities' might. A planetar can call down rain to relieve a drought, or can loose an insect plague to devour crops. A planetar's celestial ears detect every falsehood, and its radiant eyes see through every deception.  Planetars are muscular and hairless and have  opalescent green skin and white-feathe red wings. They tower over most humanoids, brandishing immense swords with grace. Sometimes sent to aid powerful mortals on important tasks for good, planetars are especially fond of missions that involve battling fiends.

Quaggoth,"Savage and territorial, quaggoths climb the chasms of the Underdark. They maul their foes in a frenzy, becoming even more murderous in the face of death.  Quaggoth Origins. Quaggoths were never an  enlightened species, but they were not a lways  the brutal Underdark denizens they are today. In a distant age, quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal arboreal hunters, possessing their own language and culture . When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark did the quaggoths survive.  As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird magic of their new realm transformed them. Turning increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food they could find-and when they could not find it, they preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of their culture, their past was abandoned.  Servants of the Drow. The ancient enmity between quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging their ferocity while strengthening their obedience. Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on surface raids against known elven enclaves.  Thonots. Some quaggoths absorb psionic energy that  suffuses certain parts of the Underdark. When a tribe discovers that one of its own has inherited such powers, they press it into the role of tribal shaman, or thonot. A thonot keep a tribe's lore and ensures its superiority against enemies. A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual,  in the hope that its power passes to another more worthy quaggoth.  Poison Immunity. Generations of hunting venomous subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced quaggoths to adapt immunities to poisons of all kinds. "

Rakshasa,"The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.  Evil Spirits in Mortal Flesh. Rakshasas originated  long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.  Evil Reborn. For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms- a process that cart take months or years. When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it.  If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its killer's family, friends, or descendants.  Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are  forever destroyed. "

Revenant,"A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.  Hunger for Revenge. A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.  Divine]ustice. No magic can hide a creature pursued  by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.  Undead Nature. A revenant doesn't require air, food,  drink, or sleep. "

Roc,"At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.  Sky Titans. In the ancient days when giants battled dragons for control of the world, Ann am, the father of the giant gods, created the roes so that his worshipers might challenge the dragons' dominance of the air. When the war ended, the roes were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world.  Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes  tame these great birds, roes treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons. Remote and Alone. Roes are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.  Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the  caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles. More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the roes' infrequent mating.  ?ti  =ts=  ~.....,...._,::.::--  - 1  . .., Roc Gargantuan monstrosity, unaligned  Armor Class 15  (natural armor) Hit Points 248  (16d20 + 80) Speed 20ft., fly  120ft.

Roper,"Living in caves and caverns throughout the Underdark, voracious ropers feast on whatever they can catch and seize. A roper eats any creature, from Underdark beasts to adventurers and their gear.  A roper has the appearance of a stalagmite or  stalactite, which often allows it to attack with surprise. The creature can move slowly using thousands of sticky cilia beneath its base. It creeps up cave walls and along stone ceilings, finding the best position from which to attack.  Underdark Hunters. The roper is an evolved, mature form of piercer, with which it shares its rock like appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of its stony teeth.  A roper can digest anything it eats with the exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic items,'~hich can sometimes be retrieved from the creature's gizzard after death. A roper's digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.  Weakening Tendrils. A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in. If a tendril is cut through or broken, the roper produces a new one to replace it. "
Rust Monster,"Most dwarves would rather face a squad of orcs than confront a single rust monster. These strange, normally c;locile creatures corrode ferrous metals, then gobble up the rust they create. In doing so, they have ruined the armor, shields, and weapons of countless adventurers.  A rust monster's body is covered in thick, lumpy armor, its long tail ends in a bony protrusion, and two feathery antennae sprout from  its insectile head.  Underground Scavengers. Rust monsters roam  subterranean passages in search of ferrous metals such as iron, steel, adamantine, and mithral to consume. They ignore creatures not carrying such metals, but can become aggressive toward those bearing steel weapons and armor. A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent's source to corrode and consume the object.  A rust monster doesn't care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them. Subterranean Wanderers. Rust monsters are rarely  found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other Underdark denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed,  they can also become friendly companions or pets. "

Sahuagin,"Across fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of a ll who hear it. This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn-a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as ""sea devils,"" for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.  Devils of the Deep. S ahuagin are a predatory, piscine  race that ventures from the ocean's black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.  The self-styled rulers of  sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terriblcy  foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.  Way of the Shark. Sahuagin worship the shark god  Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god's power,  and prieste$Ses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.  Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of  fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don't prey on them.  Elven Enmity. The sahuagin might control the oceans  if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.  So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti- a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves- or whether it preceded or even began the conflict- none can say.  The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities a nd the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin invasion. "
Satyr,"Satyrs are raucous fey that frolic in wild forests, driven by curiosity and hedonism in equal measure.  Satyrs resemble stout male humans with the furry lower bodies and cloven hooves of goats. Horns sprout from their heads, ranging in shape from a pair of small nubs to large, curling rams' horns. They typically sport facial hair.  Hedonistic Revelers. Satyrs crave the strongest drink, the most fragrant spices, and the most dizzying dances. A satyr feels starved when it can't indulge itself, and it goes to great lengths to sate its desires. It might kidnap a fine minstrel to hear lovely songs, sneak through a well-defended garden to gaze upon a beautiful lad or lass, or infiltrate a palace to taste the finest food in the land. Satyrs allow no festivity to pass them by. They partake in any holiday they've heard of.  Civilizations of the world have enough festivals and holy days among them to justify nonstop celebration.  Inebriated on drink and pleasure, satyrs give no  thought to the consequences of the hedonism they incite in others. They leave such creatures mystified at their own behavior. Such revelers might have to scrounge for excuses  to explain their disordered state to parents, employers, family, or friends. "

Sea Hag," ,..  Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters. Beauty drives a sea hag to fits  of anger. When confronted with something beautiful, the hag might simply attack it or deface it.  If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.  Ugly Inside and Out. Sea hags are by far the ugliest of a ll  hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.  Covens. A sea hag that is part of a coven (see the ""Hag  Covens"" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP). "

Shadow,"Shadows are undead that resemble dark exaggerations of humanoid shadows.  Dark Disposition. From the darkness, the shadow reaches out to feed on living creatures' vitality. They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.  If a creature from which a shadow has been created  somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its ""parent"" to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed. Undead Nature. A shadow doesn't require air,  food, drink, or sleep. "

Shambling Mound,"A shambling mound, sometimes called a shambler, trudges ponderously through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests , consuming any organic matter in its path. This rotting heap of animated vegetation looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless ""head"" at its top.  All-Consuming Devourers. A shambling mound feeds on any organic material, tirelessly consuming plants as it moves and devouring animals that can't escape it.  Only the shambling mounds' rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.  ..)  Unseen Hunters. Composed of decaying leaves,  vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come  ce to  them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.  Spawned by Lightning. A shambling mound results  from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey  magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it,  mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.  The Weed that Walks. The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the rotting heap that it simultaneously accumulates and feeds on, which protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from any creature.  •  Large plant, unaligned  Armor Class  15  (natural armor) Hit  Points 136  (16d10 + 48) Speed 20ft., swim  20ft.

Solar," A solar is godlike in its glory and power. On the battlefield, the solar's sword flies into the fray on its own, and a single arrow from a solar's bow can strike a target dead on contact. So great is a solar's celestial might that even demon princes shrink at its resonant commands.  It is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that are known are stewards of specific deities. The others rest in a state of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good. "
Spectator," A spectator is a lesser beholder that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four beholder eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual's magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyes talks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.  Magical Guardians. A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner's choice  for  101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes.  It otherwise never abandons its post.  Glimmers of Madness. Though it can speak, a  spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner.  Like any beholder, a spectator views itself as the  epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.  Freed from Service. When a spectator has fulfilled  its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died.

Specter,"A specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some a re spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.  Beyond Redemption. When a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No s uch rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with th e destruction of its soul.  Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.  Undying Hatred. Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.  DweJ/ers in Darkness. Sunlight represents a  source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final  resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.  Undead Nature. A specter doesn't require air, food,  drink, or sleep. "

Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.  Forest Protectors. Sprites build little villages in the  boughs of trees a nd willing treants , in verdant glades brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools.

While they slumber,  the sprites make good their escape, retreating to an even more secluded area of the forest.  Heart Seers. Sprites can sense whether a creature is  good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart. Weighing the bala nce of a creature's past actions, a s prite can tell whether its heart beats rapidly in love or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or greed. The s prite's power to perceive the heart always shows  the truth, because the heart can't lie.  Poison Brewers. In their forest doma ins, s prites brew  toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons , including the sleep pois on with which they coat their arrows. They venture .far into the woods to harvest ra re flowers, mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous ter ritory to do so. If desperate, s prites even steal their ingredients  from the gardens of hags.  Good-Hearted. Because they a re judges of the heart a nd favor good creatures, s prites oppose the will of evil fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn. If they encounter adventurers on a quest to r id their forest of a n evil fey creature or goblinoid menace, they will pledge their s upport and even come to their aid when the adventurers least expect it.  Unlike pixies, sprites rarely indulge in frivolous  merriment and fun. They are firm wa rriors, protectors, a nd judges, and their stern bent causes other fey to consider them overly dour and serious. However, fey that respect the s prites' territory fi nd them staunch allies in times of trouble. "

The destructive potential of the tarrasque is so vast that some cultures incorporate the monster into religious doctrine, weaving its sporadic appearance into stories of divine judgment and wrath. Legends tell how the tarrasque slumbers in its secret lair beneath the earth, remaining in a dormant state for decades or centuries. When it awakens in answer to some inscrutable cosmic call, it rises from the depths to obliterate everything in its  path. "

Troll,"Born with horrific appetites, trolls eat anything they can catch and devour. They have no society to speak of,  but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control,  however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.  Regeneration. Smashing a troll's bones and slashing  through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll's wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll's flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.  Troll Freaks. Their regenerative capabilities make  trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from  the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature's traits. "
Twig Blight," Twig blights can root in soil, which they do when living prey are scarce. While rooted, they resemble woody shrubs.

Twig blights seek out campsites and watering holes, rooting there to set up ambushes for  potential victims coming to drink or rest. Huddled together in groups, twig blights blend in with an area's natural vegetation or with piles of debris or firewood.  Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly  susceptible to fire. "
Umber Hulk,"An abominable horror from deep beneath the earth, an umber hulk burrows into cave complexes, dungeons, or Underdark settlements in search of food. Those lucky enough to survive an umber hulk attack often remember precious little of the incident, thanks to the umber hulk's mind-scrambling gaze.  Devious Delvers. Umber hulks can burrow through  solid rock, forming new tunnels in their wake. The steel-ha rd chitin of its body can withstand the cave-ins, tunnel collapses, and rock falls that commonly follow it.

Unicorn,"Unicorns dwell in enchanted forests. Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight.  A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk.  Unicorns allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to  hunt or gather food,  but they hold evil ever at bay.  Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive.  Divine Guardians. Good deities placed unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an enchanted forest.  However, the gods sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures pursue at their peril.  Unicorns most often serve deities of the forest and  woodlands, including the gods of benevolent fey. Although all unicorns have natural healing power, some serve the gods in greater capacities, performing miracles normally reserved for  high priests.  Forest Lords. A unicorn's forest is a celestial realm  where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled leaves escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears each breathy tune sung by the elves that reside amid the treetops. It senses where every caterpillar spins its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright butterfly rests its tired wings.  In a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades. From  wolves and foxes to  birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, the creatures of a unicorn's domain seem quite tame. Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally mercurial fey loyally serve a unicorn when they dwell within its woods. Under a unicorn's protection, creatures feel safe from the threat of encroach ing civilization and the insidious spread of evil.  A unicorn roams its domain constantly,  moving ever  so carefully so as not to disturb other denizens. A creature might catch a passing glimpse of the unicorn then sudden ly see nothing but the wild woods.  Sacred Horns. A unicorn's horn is the focus of its power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling ivory. Wands of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force. Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll ink, or use it as a component in eldritch rituals. However, any creature that takes a role, no matter how small, in slaying a unicorn is likely to ' become the target of divine retribution.  Blessed Mounts. When darkness and evil  threaten  to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit  to  pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods' direct intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm. It is a holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and banish devils back to the Nine Hells.  As long as the troubled times of darkness persist, the unicorn stays by the champion, its horn shining brightly to drive back the night. However, if the gods' champion falls from grace or turns from the cause of righteousness and good, the unicorn departs, never to  return.  A UNICORN's  LAIR A unicorn's lair might be an ancient ruin overgrown with vines, a misty clearing surrounded by mighty oaks, a flower-covered  hilltop alive with butterflies, or some other serene woodland location.

Violet Fungus," This purplish mushroom uses root-like feelers growing from its base to creep across cavern floors. The four stalks protruding from a violet fungi's central mass are used to lash out at prey, rotting flesh with the slightest touch. Any creature killed by a violet fungus decomposes rapidly. A new violet fungus sprouts from the moldering corpse, growing to full size in 2d6 days. "

Water Elemental," A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures that stand against it, filling their mouths and lungs as easily as it smothers flame."
Water Weird,"A water weird is an elemental guardian bound to a specific water-filled location, such as a pool or founfain. Invisible while immersed in water, its serpentine shape becomes clear only when it emerges to attack, using its coils to crush any creature other than its summoner and those its summoner declares as off limits. When slain, a water weird becomes an inanimate pool of water. Good and Evil Weirds. Like most elementals, a water weird has no concept of good or evil. However, a water weird bound to a sacred or befouled source of water begins to take on the nature of that site, becoming neutral good or neutral evil.  A neutral good water weird tries to frighten away interlopers rather than kill them, while a neutral evil water weird kills its victims for pleasure and might turn against its summoner. A water weird loses its evil alignment if its waters are cleansed with a purify food and drink spell.  Elemental Nature. A water weird doesn't require air,  food, drink, or sleep.

Werebear," Werebears are powerfullycanthropes with the ability to temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine form's fur. A were bear is a loner by nature, fearing what might happen to innocent creatures around it when its bestial nature takes over. "
Wereboar," Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms,  they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form,  they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its victims resist the curse, the more savage and bestial they become.  Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest  areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of strangers but sometimes ally themselves with orcs. "

Wererat," Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly,  avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in  humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form,  it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.  A wererat clan operates much like a  thieves' guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed.  Wererat clans are found  throughout urban civilization,  often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats. "
Weretiger," Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly muscular in  humanoid form,  they are taller than average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers grow to enormous size in animal and hybrid form,  but they fight in their more refined humanoid form when they can. They don't like to  pass on their curse, because every new were tiger means competition for territory and prey.  Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to  isolated settlements to trade or revel. They live and hunt alone or in small family groups. "
Werewolf," A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tenqency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fears9me predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form,  though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.  Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after  becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.

Will-o'-Wisp,"Will-o'-wisps are malevolent, wispy balls of light that haunt lonely places and battlefields, bound by dark fate or dark magic to feed on fear and despair.  Hope and Doom. Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing lantern lights in the distance, although they can choose to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that follow them.  Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand  pits, monster lairs, a nd other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of thei r prey and revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering fla me.  Consumed by Despair. Will-o'-wisps a re the souls of  evil  beings that perished in anguish or misery as they wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow stoops even heavier tha n the low-hanging mist and fog.  Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and memory, w ill-o'-wisps lure other creatures toward dismal fates and feed on their misery.  Agents of Evil. Will-o'-wisps rarely speak,  but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil a llies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life  goes out in a creature's eyes.

Wyvern,"Travelers in the wild sometimes look to the skies to see the dark-winged shape of a wyvern carrying its prey. These cousins to the great dragons hunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.  A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.  Aerial Hunters. A wyvern doesn't fight on  the ground  unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option. If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low,  keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.  Aggressive and Reckless. A wyvern intent on its prey  backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows .  Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from  the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to  possible ambushes. Tamed Wyverns. A wyvern can be tamed for  use as  a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.

Yeti,"A yeti's windborne howl sounds out across remote mountains, striking fear into the hearts of the scattered miners and herders that dwell there. These hulking creatures stalk alpine peaks in a ceaseless hunt for food.  Their snow-white fur lets them move like ghosts against the frozen landscape. A yeti's icy simian eyes can freeze its prey in place.  Keen Hunters. Folk of the high peaks travel in groups  and go armed, knowing that yetis can smell living flesh from miles away. When it finds prey, a yeti moves quickly over ice and stone to claim its meal, howling to the thrill of the hunt. Even in a blizzard, the scent of its quarry draws the yeti through the cold and snow.  Yetis hunt in solitude or in small family groups. When  creatures flee from a yeti or engage it in battle, other yetis might catch the scent of blood and close in. The territorial yetis fight one another for the spoils of such battles, and yetis slain in the fight are also eaten, amid euphoric howls.  Terrifying Howlers. Before an avalanche, a blizzard,  or a deadly frost, the yetis' howls sweep down the mountain slopes on the icy wind. Some people of the a lpine peaks believe that the voices of loved ones killed in avalanches and blizzards sound out in the wails of the yetis, crying warnings of ill omen. More pragmatic folk attest that the yeti's howl is a reminder that, despite the great accomplishments of civilization, the civilized become the hunted in nature's untamed domain. Brutal Rampagers. When mountain herds are  abundant, yetis stay clear of humanoid realms. Driven by hunger, they attack humanoid settlements in waves; breaking down gates and stockade walls that once might have daunted them, then devouring the creatures within.  Devious mountain folk sometimes use the yetis as unwitting weapons. A warlord might lay down slaughtered sheep or goats to draw yetis into an enemy's camp, sowing chaos and thinning the ranks before battle. Mountain clan chiefs, wanting to expand their territory, overhunt local game to diminish the yetis' food supplies, inspiring attacks on humanoid settlements that are swiftly annexed in the aftermath.  Abominable Yetis. An abominable yeti is larger than a normal yeti, standing three times as tall as a human. It typically lives and hunts alone, though a pair of abominable yetis might live together long enough to raise young. These towering yetis are highly territorial and savage, attacking and devouring any warm-blooded creatures they encounter, then scattering the bones across the ice and snow.
